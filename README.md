# Dispatch-Challenge

Goal of this challenge was to create a command-line tool or script in Python that does the following:

* Takes a home or building address as input
* Retrieves information about that address from at least three different APIs
* Combines information into a machine-readable format and either prints it to the screen or
outputs it to a file

Clone down this repository, run ```ruby ruby.rb``` and begin entering your address
